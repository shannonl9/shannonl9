Hi, I’m Shannon Lee, a junior at Southern Methodist University studying Accounting, Applied Math, and Statistics.
I’m always down to start projects or brainstorm ideas and love to get involved in the community.
This is my first Github account so I am trying to learn how to navigate this platform day by day.
